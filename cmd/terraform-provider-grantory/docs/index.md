# grantory Provider
Grantory lets separate teams push requests and reconcile approvals through Terraform/OpenTofu without sharing stateful code.


## Quick start

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    grantory = {
      source = "tasansga/grantory"
    }
  }
}

provider "grantory" {
  server = "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

## Core concepts

- **Hosts** register labels and become the target for requests.
- **Requests** capture declarative work orders that can be filtered or listed.
- **Registers** store lightweight metadata or state that can be read without granting additional work.
- **Grants** approve a request and can carry additional response data such as credentials.
- **Data sources** exist for hosts, requests, grants, and registers so you can inspect outstanding work without creating new state.
