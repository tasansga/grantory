{{ else }}
Grantory lets teams push requests and approvals through Terraform/OpenTofu, loosely coupled without having to wire in various terraform remote states.
{{ end }}

## Quick start

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

## Core concepts

- **Hosts** register labels and become the target for requests.
- **Requests** capture declarative work orders that can be filtered or listed.
- **Registers** capture lightweight metadata or state that should be stored without producing a grant.
- **Grants** approve a request and can carry additional response data such as credentials.
- **Data sources** exist for hosts, requests, grants, and registers so you can inspect outstanding work without creating new state.
